# NLP Text Classification using NLTK on SMAP Dataset

This project applies Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques using **NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)** to analyze and classify text data from the **SMAP dataset**. It demonstrates preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and performance evaluation — providing insights into class-wise predictions and overall model accuracy.

## Project Overview

The objective of this project is to build a robust **text classification model** capable of identifying and categorizing textual data based on learned linguistic patterns.  
Using NLTK’s preprocessing and tokenization tools, the dataset was cleaned and prepared before training a supervised model for classification.

## Tech Stack

- **Python**
- **NLTK** – for tokenization, stemming, and text preprocessing  
- **Scikit-learn** – for model building and evaluation  
- **Pandas / NumPy** – for data handling  
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** – for visualization

## Workflow

1. **Data Loading**
   - Imported the SMAP text dataset.
   - Performed initial inspection and cleanup.

2. **Text Preprocessing**
   - Tokenization and stopword removal  
   - Lemmatization for word normalization  

3. **Feature Extraction**
   - Converted text into numerical form using **TF-IDF Vectorization**.  

4. **Model Building**
   - Trained a classification model  
   - Split data into training and testing sets.  

5. **Evaluation**
   - Calculated **accuracy**.  
   - Displayed **class-wise predictions**.

## Results

- Achieved **Model Accuracy:** `98 %`  
- Displayed **Class-wise outputs** showing model’s performance on each category.
